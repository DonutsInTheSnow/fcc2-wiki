# fcc2-wiki
The example provided by FreeCodeCamp uses Pug for html markup and Angular for JavaScript. 
My version uses Vanilla JavaScript with bootstrap5 for styling.

# Wikipedia Viewer

## Objective
Build an app that is functionally similar to this [example](https://codepen.io/freeCodeCamp/full/wGqEga/).

The MediaWiki software powers Wikipedia, helping to collect and organize knowledge and make it available to people.

Using the MediaWiki API, replicate the search function and random article function, similar to the example app above. You can use Wikipedia as your data source.

Fulfill the below user stories and get all of the tests to pass. Use whichever libraries or APIs you need. Give it your own personal style.

## User Stories
1. **Search Functionality**: Users can search Wikipedia entries in a search box and see the resulting Wikipedia entries.
2. **Random Article**: Users can click a button to see a random Wikipedia entry.

## Completion
When you are finished, include a link to your project on CodePen and click the "I've completed this challenge" button.

You can get feedback on your project by sharing it on the freeCodeCamp forum.
